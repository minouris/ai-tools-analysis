### AI-Assisted Analysis

The analyses in this repository were conducted by **[GitHub Copilot Coding Agent](https://github.com/features/copilot)** (using the **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** model via Anthropic API) working under instruction and guidance from the author. The AI agent followed standardised methodology and guidelines to ensure comprehensive and consistent evaluation.

### Important Disclaimer

⚠️ **Verify Before Use**: While analyses are based on official documentation and follow rigorous methodology, they are AI-generated content and may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information. Users should:

- **Verify critical information** against official documentation before making decisions
- **Check version compatibility** as tools evolve rapidly
- **Test features** in your own environment before relying on them
- **Cross-reference** with multiple sources for important decisions

The analyses are provided as a research resource and starting point, not as authoritative or guaranteed-accurate information.
